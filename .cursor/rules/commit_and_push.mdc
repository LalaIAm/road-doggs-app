# Git Branching & Commit Policy

## Branching

- For every **major feature or significant change**, always create a **new git branch** from the main development branch before writing code.
- Use clear, descriptive branch names (e.g. `feature/auth-flow`, `feature/dashboard-metrics`).
- Never commit directly to `main` or `develop` unless explicitly instructed.
- If there is any uncertainty about whether work qualifies as a major feature, **default to creating a new branch**.

## Commits

- Treat each **completed task** as a commit boundary.
- A task is considered complete when:
  - The implementation is finished
  - The solution is correct and stable
  - No immediate follow-up changes are required

- After completing a task, the agent must:
  1. Stage only the relevant changes
  2. Create a clear, descriptive commit message
  3. Push the commit to GitHub immediately

- Do not bundle multiple completed tasks into a single commit.
- Do not continue working on a feature without committing completed tasks.

## Enforcement

- Always assume a new branch is required unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Always push commits after task completion.
